|**** GREEDY ALGORITHMS ****|

If any point of time the changes in local answer will impact and contribute to the Global answer then it involves Greedy Approach.

Ques: Is greedy going to work every time?
Ans: NO. eg - Finding a Minimum distance in graph problem, where greedy algo will fail giving right result.
    D
  1/   \3
A - 2 - B
  1\  /4
    C

 In above problem, Greedy algo will ignore AB to get minimum distance and will move either to AC or AD. This wil yield wrong result.

 Thus, MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY of each step with another is the desired trait.


 Q - Real life example of Greedy Algorithm?
 Ans: In Compression Algorithm. eg-
    1. Huffman Encoding and Decoding.
    2. Minimum Spanning Tree.
